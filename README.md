# D3_Data_Journalism

I was tasked to analyze the current trends shaping people's lives, as well as creating charts, graphs, and interactive elements to help readers understand my findings.
The editor wants to run a series of feature stories about the health risks facing particular demographics. She's counting on you to sniff out the first story idea by sifting through information from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.
The data set included with the assignment is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates: https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml. The current data set incldes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. MOE stands for "margin of error."

I placed additional labels in the scatter plot and give them click events so that the users can decide which data to display, Animating the transitions for the circles' locations as well as the range of the axes. I created three risk factors for each axis.
Please go to settings and click the website to see the visualization of the scatter plot.
